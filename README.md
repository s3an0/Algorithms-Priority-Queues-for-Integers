# Algorithms-Priority-Queues-for-Integers
Project created for an Algorithms class that utilizes priority queues to organize given integer data such as film review scores

About:
The project utilizes a combination of arrays, priority queues, and heap sorts to order from greatest to least. The first set of numbers are random, but will then be ordered.
The next set of data uses a various number of films that contain a film name, release year, and review score. These will also be ordered.

When running the project, the output will be similar to the result below:

Unordered Integers:
455 21 717 147 344 202 697 670 517 550 311 292 721 347 673 127 510 514 875 660 
Ordered Integers:
875 721 717 697 673 670 660 550 517 514 510 455 347 344 311 292 202 147 127 21 
Unordered Films:
Star Wars: 92% | The Last Airbender: 5% | Seven Samurai: 100% | Spirited Away: 97% | Independence Day: 67% | Citizen Kane: 100% | Gone with the Wind: 91% | Godzilla: 93% | Fantasia: 95% | Robot Monster: 36% | 
Ordered Films (Score):
Citizen Kane: 100% | Seven Samurai: 100% | Spirited Away: 97% | Fantasia: 95% | Godzilla: 93% | Star Wars: 92% | Gone with the Wind: 91% | Independence Day: 67% | Robot Monster: 36% | The Last Airbender: 5% |
